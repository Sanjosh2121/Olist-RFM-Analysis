# Olist E-commerce: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) & RFM Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
![Dashboard Preview](dashboard_preview.png)
This project analyzes **93,357 unique customers** from the Olist E-commerce dataset to identify high-value segments and churn risks. Using a combination of **Python (Pandas/SQLAlchemy)** for data engineering and **Tableau** for interactive visualization, I developed a robust segmentation engine to drive marketing strategy.

## 🛠️ Technical Challenges & Skepticism
During the research phase, I initially attempted to implement the **BG/NBD probabilistic model**. However, due to the high data sparsity (97% of customers being one-time buyers), the model failed to converge. 

So then I pivoted to a **Heuristic RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Scoring System** using quantile-based ranking. This ensured 100% data coverage and provided more stable, actionable insights for the business.

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Revenue Concentration:** The "Champions" segment represents only **4.6%** of the customer base but exhibits the highest individual value.
* **Retention Opportunity:** The "At Risk" segment (39% of customers) holds over **$5.5M** in historical revenue, marking it as the primary target for re-engagement.
* **New Growth:** A significant portion of the base consists of recent one-time shoppers ($R=5, F=1$), representing the best opportunity for a "Second-Purchase" conversion campaign.
